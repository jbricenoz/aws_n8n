# N8N on AWS: Complete Step-by-Step Guide

This guide walks you through deploying N8N on AWS using Terraform, Docker, and Bash scripts. It is designed for beginners in DevOps/SRE and covers everything from AWS setup to production best practices.

---

## 1. Prerequisites
- **AWS Account** (with permissions to create EC2, RDS, ALB, Route53, ElastiCache, etc.)
- **Domain Name** in Route53 (for HTTPS and custom DNS)
- **Local Machine:**
  - [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
  - [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
  - [Docker & Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

---

## 1a. Check Local Prerequisites (Recommended)
Before starting, run the provided script to check your local environment:

```sh
chmod +x setup_requisites.sh
./setup_requisites.sh
```
- This script checks for AWS CLI, Terraform, Docker, Docker Compose, and AWS credentials.
- If you see a "permission denied" error, ensure you ran the `chmod +x` command above.

## 2. Configure AWS Credentials
Set up your AWS credentials so Terraform and CLI tools can access your account:
```sh
aws configure
```
Enter your AWS Access Key, Secret Key, region, and output format.

---

## 3. Deploy AWS Infrastructure with Terraform
1. Go to the Terraform folder:
   ```sh
   cd n8n-aws-terraform
   ```
2. Edit `variables.tf` to set your AWS region, VPC/subnet IDs, domain, and other variables (see comments in the file).
3. Initialize and apply the Terraform configuration:
   ```sh
   terraform init
   terraform apply
   ```
   - This will create VPC, subnets, security groups, EC2, RDS (Postgres), ALB (with HTTPS), Redis, Route53 DNS, and persistent EBS storage for N8N.
4. After apply, note the outputs: EC2 public DNS, ALB DNS, RDS endpoint, Redis endpoint, etc.

---

## 4. Prepare Your Environment Variables
- Copy the `.env` example from `n8n-aws-docker/README.md` and fill in your secrets, DB, and Redis connection details using the Terraform outputs.
- For bash-based setup, edit `n8n-aws-bash/setup_env.sh` with the same details.

---

## 5. Set Up N8N on EC2
### Option A: Use Bash Scripts (manual/SSH)
1. SSH into your EC2 instance:
   ```sh
   ssh ubuntu@<ec2-public-dns>
   ```
2. Run the scripts in `n8n-aws-bash/` in order:
   - `bash install_prerequisites.sh` (installs Docker, Node.js)
   - Edit and `source setup_env.sh` (set your secrets/DB/Redis)
   - `bash run_n8n.sh` (starts N8N in Docker)

### Option B: Use Docker Compose (for local dev or custom EC2 AMI)
1. Go to `n8n-aws-docker/` and update your `.env` file.
2. Run:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

---

## 6. Access N8N
- Use your Route53 domain (e.g., https://n8n.example.com) or ALB DNS to access N8N in your browser.
- Login with the credentials set in your environment variables.

---

## 7. Production Best Practices
- **Database:** Uses AWS RDS PostgreSQL (managed, backed up, secure).
- **HTTPS:** All traffic goes through AWS ALB with SSL (ACM certificate required).
- **Scaling:** Redis (ElastiCache) is provisioned for n8n queue mode (see n8n docs for scaling horizontally).
- **Persistence:** N8N data is stored on an encrypted EBS volume attached to EC2. Set up EBS snapshots for backup.
- **Backups:** (Optional) Use S3 sync or EBS snapshot automation for extra redundancy.
- **Security:** All secrets are managed via environment variables and security groups restrict access.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting & Customization
- See `n8n-aws-docker/README.md` and `n8n-aws-bash/README.md` for more details.
- For advanced scaling, SSL, or monitoring, see the [official n8n docs](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/).

**You now have a production-grade, scalable, and secure N8N deployment on AWS!**

# Appendix: n8n AWS Terraform Implementation â€“ Step by Step

This section provides a deeper dive into the `n8n-aws-terraform` implementation, explaining each step, the AWS services involved, and why they are needed. Use this as a reference for customizing or understanding the infrastructure-as-code approach for n8n on AWS.

## Overview

The `n8n-aws-terraform` module automates the provisioning of all core AWS resources required for a secure, scalable n8n deployment. It ensures best practices for networking, security, persistence, and scaling.

### Services Used & Why

| Service      | Purpose                                                                 |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| VPC          | Isolates resources within a private network                             |
| Subnets      | Separates public-facing and private resources                           |
| Security Groups | Controls inbound/outbound traffic for EC2, RDS, etc.                |
| EC2          | Hosts the n8n application                                              |
| RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL) | Provides a managed, persistent database for n8n             |
| S3/EFS       | Stores workflow data, files, and backups                               |
| IAM          | Manages permissions and access for services                            |
| CloudWatch (optional) | Monitors logs and metrics                                     |

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Prerequisites
- **AWS Account** with sufficient permissions
- **Terraform** installed locally
- **AWS CLI** configured (`aws configure`)
- (Optional) **Docker** if using Docker-based n8n deployment

### 2. Initialize Terraform
- Clone or navigate to the `n8n-aws-terraform` directory.
- Run:
  ```sh
  terraform init
  ```

### 3. Configure Variables
- Edit `variables.tf` to set AWS region, instance types, DB passwords, domain, etc.
- This makes the deployment reusable and easy to customize.

### 4. Networking
- **VPC:** Creates a dedicated AWS network for isolation.
- **Subnets:** Public for load balancer; private for EC2 and RDS.
- **Security Groups:** Only allow necessary traffic (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS to ALB, DB access only from EC2).

*Why?* Secure, segmented networking is crucial for production workloads.

### 5. Database (RDS)
- Provisions an RDS instance (PostgreSQL or MySQL) for n8n to store workflows and credentials.
- Placed in a private subnet for security.
- Security group restricts access to only the n8n EC2 instance(s).

*Why?* Managed databases are reliable, scalable, and secure.

### 6. Compute (EC2)
- Launches an EC2 instance to run n8n.
- Uses a user-data script (see `scripts/user_data.sh`) to automate installation and startup.
- Optionally runs n8n in Docker for easier management.

*Why?* EC2 provides flexibility, and Docker simplifies upgrades and scaling.

### 7. Storage (EBS, S3, EFS)
- **EBS:** Persistent, encrypted volume attached to EC2 for n8n data.
- **S3:** (Optional) For backups or file storage.
- **EFS:** (Optional) For shared storage if running multiple EC2 instances.

*Why?* Ensures data is not lost if instances are replaced or scaled.

### 8. IAM Roles & Policies
- EC2 gets an IAM role with permissions to access S3, RDS, and CloudWatch (if used).
- Follows the principle of least privilege.

### 9. User Data & Automation
- Scripts like `set_n8n_env.sh` and `user_data.sh` automate environment setup and n8n installation.
- Ensures that EC2 instances are ready to serve n8n immediately after launch.

### 10. Outputs & Access
- Terraform outputs important info: n8n URL, RDS endpoint, etc.
- Access n8n via the ALB DNS or your custom domain.

## Customization & Extending
- Adjust variables in `variables.tf` for your needs (scaling, DB size, etc.).
- Add CloudWatch for logging/monitoring.
- Integrate ACM for SSL certificates and ALB for HTTPS.
- Use Route53 for custom DNS.

## Final Notes
- Always review security group rules and IAM permissions.
- Use EBS snapshots and/or S3 sync for backups.
- For advanced scaling, use ElastiCache (Redis) and n8n queue mode.
